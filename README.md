## 🚩 Selected Work & Projects

### 1️⃣ Wild Edible Macrofungi Classification – Ensemble & Explainable AI

- Co-authored a study on **high-accuracy classification of wild edible macrofungi** using an **ensemble of EfficientNetB0, ResNet50 and RegNetY**.  
- Achieved **strong performance (high accuracy and AUC)** compared to individual models.  
- Leveraged **Explainable AI** techniques such as Grad-CAM, Eigen-CAM and LIME to interpret model decisions.  
- The framework is applicable not only to macrofungi but also to tasks like **plant recognition, spore analysis and ecosystem monitoring**.

> **Keywords:** Computer Vision, Ensemble Learning, Explainable AI, Biological Imaging

---

### 2️⃣ Tumor Image Classification (Medical Imaging)

- Developed a **CNN-based tumor classification model** on medical image data.  
- Due to strict privacy constraints, raw images are not shared; instead, the **model architecture, training pipeline and evaluation setup** are documented.  
- Explored **interpretability** to make model decisions more clinically meaningful (e.g. heatmaps and saliency maps).

> **Focus:** Medical imaging, privacy-aware ML, model interpretability.

---

### 3️⃣ 5G Signal-Based Positioning Project

- Worked in a team on a **5G localization / signal-based positioning** project.  
- Used **Python and QGIS** for path-loss modelling, signal propagation analysis and location estimation.  
- Open-sourced **simulation and modelling components** (where data confidentiality allows) to enable reproducibility and future extensions.

> **Keywords:** Wireless communication, signal processing, localization, simulation.

---

### 4️⃣ LLM Collector & RAG-Oriented Pipeline

- Designed a system that periodically collects text data from the **web/RSS around a specific topic**,  
- Stores raw text in **MongoDB** and vector representations in **Qdrant**,  
- Enables **semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** on top of the collected corpus.  

**Stack:**

- Python 3.11 + Poetry  
- Sentence-Transformers (e.g. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)  
- APScheduler for periodic jobs  
- Docker Compose for local orchestration  

> The project aims to serve as a foundation for **topic-focused knowledge bases** and future LLM fine-tuning.
